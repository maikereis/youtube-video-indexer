## Data Storage Strategy

### Multi-Store Architecture
The system uses specialized data stores for different use cases:

**MongoDB (Primary Store)**:

- Document-oriented storage for flexible video metadata
- Rich querying capabilities for complex data relationships
- Atomic operations for data consistency
- Horizontal scaling through sharding

**Elasticsearch (Search Engine)**:

- Full-text search across video titles, descriptions, and tags
- Advanced filtering and aggregation capabilities
- Near real-time search updates
- Distributed architecture for high availability

**Valkey/Redis (Cache & Queue)**:

- Message queues for inter-service communication
- Rate limiting data storage
- Session management and caching
- High-performance in-memory operations

### Data Consistency
The system implements eventual consistency between stores:

- MongoDB serves as the source of truth
- Elasticsearch indices are updated asynchronously
- Failed indexing operations are retried automatically
- Data inconsistencies are detected and resolved
